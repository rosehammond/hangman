## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The game stores a list of words, which the computer will choose from at random. The user is then asked to input a letter and the game checks that this is a single letter from the alphabet.
